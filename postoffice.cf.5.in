.Sh NAME
.Nm postoffice.cf
.Nd configuration file for postoffice
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This file resides in @confdir@, and contains various configuration
options for the 
.Sy postoffice
mail server.   All of the options listed here can also be passed
directly to the
.Sy postoffice
server via the 
.Fl o
command line option.
.Pp
The format of the configuration file is one option per line, with
blank lines and lines beginning with # ignored as comment lines.
The options are:

.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Li audit
Enable session auditing.
.It Li checkhelo
Check the arguments passed with the 
.Em HELO
and
.Em EHLO
SMTP command and refuse to do an SMTP conversation with the
client if they claim to be the mail server.
.It Li clients Ns = Ns Ar N
Allow only 
.Ar N
clients at a time to connect to the server.
.It Li debug
Enable the ESMTP
.Ql DEBUG
command, which displays various compile and runtime settings,
as well as the current state of the mail envelope.  This is useful
for some types of debugging, but it may expose internal information
to the public.
.It Li delay Ns = Ns Ar N
Set the
.Em greylist Ns ing
delay to
.Ar N
seconds.
The 
.Xr delay
may be specified as a tagged number,
with
.Ql m
being minutes.
and
.Ql h
being hours.
.It Li escape-from Ns = Ns Ar N
If nonzero, all lines beginning with 'From ' in the body of the
message will be prefixed by '>'.   Some mail readers can't handle raw
'From ' lines in the middle of a message and will treat them as
the start of a new message, so mangling the message like this will
stop them from getting confused.
@MILTERMAN@.It Li filter Ns = Ns Ar socket
@MILTERMAN@Defines a sendmail filter that will scan incoming mail
@MILTERMAN@before
@MILTERMAN@.Em postoffice
@MILTERMAN@accepts it.    The 
@MILTERMAN@.Ar socket
@MILTERMAN@can be either a Unix-domain socket on the local machine
@MILTERMAN@or a tcp socket on any machine.
@MILTERMAN@Note that postoffice uses the dns 
@MILTERMAN@.Em exclusively Ns ,
@MILTERMAN@so you need to give the fully qualified domain name of
@MILTERMAN@the machine that the filter is running on.  If you don't,
@MILTERMAN@the filter just won't be called.
@MILTERMAN@If enabled, the
@MILTERMAN@.Em DEBUG
@MILTERMAN@smtp command lists all of the currently configured filters
@MILTERMAN@and their status.  A status of 00h or 0h1 means that the
@MILTERMAN@filter is active; anything else indicates an error.
.It Li forward-all
When set, forward all unknown mail to the configured
.Sy relay-host .
.It Li hops Ns = Ns Ar N
Set the hop count to
.Ar N .
The hop count is incremented every time the mail is
processed.
When it reaches this limit,
the mail is returned with an error message (the default is 100 hops).
.It Li immediate
Attempt to deliver mail to remote machines immediately instead of waiting
for the next queue run.
.It Li load Ns = Ns Ar N
When the load average is above
.Ar N ,
.Sy postoffice
will not accept SMTP connections (the default is 4).
.It Li localmx
Treat connections from sites that use this machine as an MX
as if they were local, and give them the permissions that
local clients have.
@STATFS@.It Li minfree Ns = Ns Ar N
@STATFS@Stop accepting mail when there are less than
@STATFS@.Ar N 
@STATFS@kilobytes available on the mail spool volume.
@STATFS@.Xr minfree
@STATFS@is given as a tagged number,
@STATFS@with
@STATFS@.Ql m
@STATFS@being megabytes,
@STATFS@and
@STATFS@.Ql g
@STATFS@being gigabytes
.It Li nodaemon
Do not accept mail from
.Em <> .
This can be useful for blocking spammers and viruses, but
it also violates
.%T RFC821 ,
and means that nobody at your site (including mailing lists)
will ever get bounce messages when mail cannot be delivered.
If your machine is connected to a public network,
.Em DON'T
.Em SET
.Em THIS
.Em OPTION
unless you're under attack from a malicious spammer.
.It Li paranoid
Do not accept mail from sites unless we can resolve their dns address.
.It Li qreturn Ns = Ns Ar N
Bounce undeliverable mail after 
.Ar N 
seconds.
The 
.Xr qreturn
may be specified as a tagged number,
with
.Ql m
being minutes,
.Ql h
being hours,
and
.Ql d
being days.
.It Li relay
Allow all clients to relay mail through this
server.   If your machine is connected to a public network,
.Em DON'T
.Em SET
.Em THIS
.Em OPTION ,
unless you really want to end up on every antispam blacklist on
the planet.
.It Li relay-host Ns = Ns Ar host
Send all mail destined for remote hosts via this
.Ar host .
The superuser is the only user that can use this option on the
command line or in a configuration file other than
.Pa /etc/postoffice.cf
.It Li self Ns = Ns Ar host
Set our hostname to
.Ar host .
.Sy Postoffice
normally uses the uname() system call to determine the machine name,
but you can set it to just about anything here.
.It Li size Ns = Ns Ar size
Sets the 
largest message size that 
.Sy postoffice
will accept.
.Xr size
is given as a tagged number,
with
.Ql k
being kilobytes,
and
.Ql m
being megabytes.
.It Li soft-deny
If set, refuse blacklisted and paranoid connections with a 4xx (temporary)
error status instead of the normal 5xx (permanent) errors.
.It Li spam Ns = Ns Ar option
Configure how 
.Nm postoffice
deals with spam.
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Li spam=accept
Accept the spam-infested message and deliver it like a normal message.
.Nm postoffice
will add an
.Ql X-Spam
header to the message to warn the user that this message might be
spam.
.It Li spam=bounce Ns , Ns Ar why
Refuse to accept the spam-infested message with a 5xx error during 
the
.Ql DATA
phase of the smtp session.
.Ar why
is the explanation for why it's being bounced.  It is optional and
if not supplied the message will be bounced with a default message
why.
.It Li spam=folder Ns , Ns Ar path
Accept the spam-infested message and deliver it to the users
spam mail folder.   If
.Ql path
begins with
.Ql ~/ Ns ,
it will be expanded to that file in the user's home directory.
If it does not begin with 
.Ql ~/ Ns ,
it will be expanded to a folder in the maildir named
.Li username Ns : Ns Ar path Ns .
Non-local users (and users in a virtual domain) will have the
spam-infested mail delivered as if you configured
.Ql spam=accept Ns .
.El

.It Li timeout Ns = Ns Ar timeout
Drop the connection to a client if they are idle
longer than
.Ar timeout .
This option violates the word (if not the intent) of the SMTP
specification,
so the timeout should probably be fairly large.
The 
.Xr timeout
may be specified as a tagged number,
with
.Ql m
being minutes,
.Ql h
being hours,
and
.Ql d
being days.
For example,
.Ql timeout=60m
or 
.Ql timeout=1h
both set the timeout to one hour.
.It Li usermap Ns = Ns Ar pattern:target(s)
Define personal aliases
(the format is described in the
.Xr usermap 7
manpage.)
.It Li verify-from Ns = Ns Ar flag
Check the validity of MAIL FROM addresses.  If
nonzero (the default), the address will be rejected if it's
from an unresolvable domain or if a remote client attempts to
give a local address, and if zero, anything the client gives is
okay with 
.Sy postoffice .
