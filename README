POSTOFFICE is a small SMTP mail server for UN*X-style systems.

It supports greylisting (first-time mailers need to wait a hour
before they are allowed to actually send email), tcp wrappers (to
block domains and IP addresses from sending email), can be configured
to do virus scanning of incoming mail (either via a compiled-in
call to a virus scanner or via a sendmail milter library), has a
variety of runtime options to increase how paranoid it is about
accepting mail, it can be used to deliver mail to accounts on virtual
hosts, and it supports a limited set of user-defined personal
aliases.

POSTOFFICE is free software;  it is released under a BSD-style license
that allows you to do as you wish with it as long as you don't attempt
to claim it as your own work.


Most of the programs included in the POSTOFFICE distribution have
manual pages describing how they work.

The file INSTALL describes how to build and install postoffice
