POSTOFFICE is a small SMTP mail server for UN*X-style systems.

It supports greylisting (first-time mailers need to wait a hour before
they are allowed to actually send email), tcp wrappers (to block domains
and IP addresses from sending email), can be configured to do virus
scanning of incoming mail, has a variety of runtime options to increase
how paranoid it is about accepting mail, and it can be used to deliver
mail to account on virtual hosts.

POSTOFFICE is free software;  it is released under a BSD-style license
that allows you to do as you wish with it as long as you don't attempt
to claim it as your own work.


Most of the programs included in the POSTOFFICE distribution have manual
pages describing how they work.

The file INSTALL describes how to build and install postoffice
