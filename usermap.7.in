.Nm usermap
.Nd how
.Xr postoffice 8
personal aliases work
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Personal aliases are a way of slowing down spammers by allowing users
on a system to define aliases as needed without having to give them
superuser access so they can add entries to the
.Xr aliases 5
file.   Personal aliases are configured in
.Xr postoffice.cf 5
(the
.Em usermap
configuration setting,) and may point to
.Xr aliases 5 -format Ns
files in a users home directory.


The format of a
.Em usermap
is
.Em pattern Ns : Ns Ar target{,...} ,
defined as follows:

.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ar pattern
This defines the format of the personal alias. 
It is a shell-format wildcard, with 
.Em *
matching multiple characters and 
.Em ~
matching a valid user name.   The two standard personal
alias formats (user-suffix and prefix-user) can be described
as 
.Ar ~ Ns - Ns Ar *
and
.Ar * Ns - Ns Ar ~ ,
but many other formats are possible.
.It Ar target
This is what the personal alias maps to.  It can be a simple
token like you'd find in the
.Xr aliases 5
file, but it may also be the token
.Em ~ Ns ,
which maps to the matched user name, or
.Em ~/ Ns Ar filename ,
which tells 
.Xr postoffice 8
to search the user's personal alias file 
.Em filename
for matching aliases.
.Pp
If multiple targets are present,
.Xr postoffice 8
searches them one by one, stopping when a match is made.   Every
target except
.Em ~/ Ar filename
always matches, while 
.Em ~/ Ar filename
only matches if the alias is found in it.

.Sh EXAMPLES
To set up personal aliases of the form
.Em prefix Ns - Ns Em user ,
and have them only exist if they're listed in the file
.Em ~/ Ns Ar .alias ,
you would define
.Em usermap (in 
.Xr postoffice.cf 5 )
as
.Em *-~ Ns : Ns Ar ~/.alias,bounce (
.Em ``bounce''
or any other name that's not a valid user,)
and users would have an
.Xr aliases 5 -format
file containing the desired aliases in their home directory.
.Pp
If, instead, you want all aliases to point at the user
except for ones that have been explicitly redefined, 
.Em usermap
would look like
.Em *-~ Ns : Ns Ar ~/.alias,~


.Sh BUGS
You may only match
.Em ~
once in a usermap.
.Pp
The personal alias file is treated just like a .forward file, and the
user may do anything there that they are allowed in the .forward file.
.Pp
Users in personal domains are not able to use personal aliases because
they have no actual home directories on the machine.
