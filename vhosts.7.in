.Sh DESCRIPTION
Virtual hosts are based on the virtual host method used by the vm-pop3d
pop3 mail server.   They are primarily used for setting up virtual email
accounts -- mailboxes without real accounts for them.   This allows a
system to act as a mail server for multiple domains.
.Pp
Each virtual host is listed in @VPATH@/domains.cf, and has
the following directories and files associated with
it
.Bl -tag -width @VPATH@/host/passwd
.It @VSPOOL@/host
The mail spool directory.   This directory, and all of the
spoolfiles in it, should be owned by userid @VUSER_UID@, and
in group @VUSER_GID@.
.It @VPATH@/host
The password and alias files go here.  This directory, and
all of the files that live in it, should be owned by the
user listen in @VPATH@/domains.cf.
.It @VPATH@/host/passwd
The password file.  This file is in
.Ar .htpasswd 
format (username:encrypted passwd).
.It @VPATH@/host/aliases
Mail aliases.  Virtual mail aliases work the same way as normal
mail aliases do, with the addition of the alias
.Nm * ,
which aliases every username.
.El
.Pp
Note, also, that for a virtual domain to work the dns for that domain must
point at the machine where the virtual domain is hosted, so that other machines
will send the mail to the correct place.
