		    HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL POSTOFFICE

1) Unpacking the distribution

The POSTOFFICE sources are distributed in tarballs.  After extracting from
the tarball, you should end up with all the source and build files in the
directory
		postoffice-(version)

2) Installing the distribution

POSTOFFICE uses configure.sh to set itself up for compilation.   To run
configure, just do ``./configure.sh'' and it will check your system for
build dependencies and build makefiles for you.   If configure.sh finishes
without complaint, you can then do a ``make'' to compile everything and a
``make install'' to install the binaries.

Configure.sh has a few options that can be set:

    --src=DIR		where the source lives (.)
    --prefix=DIR	where to install the final product (/usr/local)
    --execdir=DIR	where to put executables (prefix/bin)
    --libdir=DIR	where to put libraries (prefix/lib)
    --mandir=DIR	where to put manpages (prefix/man)
    --confdir=DIR	where to put configuration information (/etc)

    --with-av=SCRIPT	virus scanning script to run after receiving mail
    --with-tcpwrappers	use tcp wrappers
    --with-greylist	use the greylist code
    --with-queuedir	where to put queued mail (/var/spool/mqueue)
    --with-auth		enable smtp authentication (AUTH LOGIN)
    --use-peer-flag	enable -opeer (for debugging)
    --with-vhosts[=DIR]	enable vhosts (passwd files in DIR (/etc/virtual))
    --with-vspool=DIR	(vhost mail spool in DIR) (/var/spool/virtual)
    --with-vuser[=user]	(vhost mail files owned by) [mail]


3) Cautions and features

    a) The greylist code wants to put a database (owned by root, and by
       default only readable by root) into /var/db/smtpauth.  You may
       manually chmod the database to allow other users read and/or write
       access to it, if you so desire.
    b) POSTOFFICE uses the queue directory /var/spool/mqueue to queue up
       mail messages.  If your previous MTA has left messages in this
       directory, POSTOFFICE should ignore them, but if it doesn't your
       first runq will have surprising results.
    c) Unlike Sendmail, POSTOFFICE does not support automatic queue running;
       it expects you to put an entry into your crontab to run the mail
       queue at whatever intervals you prefer.
    d) I have not done any exhaustive checks for vulnerabilities in this
       code.   It tries not to write anything as root (except for mail
       into the root mailbox, which you can and probably should override
       with a mail alias) but the evil hackers are cleverer than I am
       by definition, and if there are vulnerabilities they will find
       them.
