.Sh NAME
.Nm smtpauth
.Nd greylist file for
.Sy postoffice
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Sy /var/db/smtpauth.db
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This file records client access to the
.Sy postoffice
SMTP server.
It contains records that either have the
address given in the SMTP
.Ql MAIL FROM:
command, or the
.Sy username
from the SMTP
.Ql MAIL FROM:
and the 
.Sy IP address
that the mail connected from.
In both cases, this address is followed by
two dates (in UNIX
.Sy time_t
format) which are, in order, the
time when 
.Nm postoffice
will accept mail from this user, and
the time
when the last connection was made.
.Pp
This file is a
.Xr @NDBM@ 3
database and is not human readable; the
.Xr authexpire 8
program is used to maintain it and remove old records.
.Pp
The record format used in this database is:
.Bl -tag -width USER@[IP] -compact
.It ADDRESS
Either the SMTP
.Ql MAIL FROM:
address or the username from that address, followed
by the IP address of the connecting machine (quoted
with 
.Ql [] )
.It DATE DATE
When the client can connect and when the client last connected (both
in seconds after the epoch).   If the client is forbidden (via the
.Fl d
flag in 
.Xr authexpire 8 ),
the first DATE will be the magic token
.Sy * .
