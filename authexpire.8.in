.Xr age
seconds.

an 80 column window, otherwise the full user keys are shown (which
may be considerably longer than the truncated size.)

Don't truncate fields when listing the contents of the greylist, even
if it's being displayed on your terminal.

Approve this user by clearing their greylist entry
.It Fl b Ar user
