.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
accepts and delivers mail on
.Em TCP/IP
networks. It includes a mail
.Em greylist ,
uses 
.Sy "TCP wrappers"
to restrict client access,
and can be configured to run antivirus
.\" and antispam
software before accepting mail for delivery.
.Pp
With no flags,
.Nm
reads its standard input
up to an end-of-file
and sends a copy of the message found there
to all of the addresses listed on the command line.
.Pp
Local addresses are looked up in a file
and aliased appropriately.
.Pp
Flags are:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
Start SMTP servers with session auditing enabled.

.Nm
will fork and run in background
listening on socket 25 for incoming SMTP
connections.

@VHOST@If a 
@VHOST@.Ar host
@VHOST@is passed on the command line, 
@VHOST@.Nm Postoffice
@VHOST@will rebuild the aliases file for that virtual host, otherwise

.Pp
Various processing options can be set when 
.Nm
is started.
Options may be set either on the command line
using the
.Fl o
flag,
in the configuration file
.Pa @confdir@/postoffice.cf ,
or in a configuration file specified by the
.Fl C
flag.
.Pp
In aliases,
the first character of a name may be
a vertical bar to cause interpretation of
the rest of the name as a command
to pipe the mail to.
It may be necessary to quote the name
to keep
.Nm
from suppressing the blanks from between arguments.
For example, a common alias is:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
msgs: "|/usr/bin/msgs -s"
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
returns an exit status
describing what it did.
